            Carbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods.
            Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with
            glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. But
            carbohydrate quality is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others:

           * Oats are an incredibly healthy whole grain and a great source of many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
            <br>
            <br>
            *  Raw oats contain 70% carbs. A 1-cup (81-gram) serving contains 54 grams of carbs, including 8 grams of
            fiber. They are particularly high in a specific type of fiber called oat beta glucan (6Trusted Source,
            7Trusted Source).
            <br>
            <br>
            * Oats are also a relatively good source of protein and contain more protein than most grains (8Trusted
            Source).
            <br>
            <br>
            * Research suggests that eating oats may reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering your cholesterol levels
            (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).
            <br>
            <br>
            * Eating oats may also lower blood sugar levels, especially in people with type 2 diabetes (12Trusted Source).
            <br>
            <br>
            * Furthermore, oats are very filling, which could help support healthy weight management (13Trusted Source,

            * Bananas are a popular fruit people love to use in many different recipes.

            One large banana (136 grams) contains about 31 grams of carbs, either in the form of starches or sugars
            (20Trusted Source).

            <br>
            * Sweet potatoes are a delicious, nutritious tuber or root vegetable.

            One-half cup (100 grams) of mashed, cooked sweet potatoes with their skin on contains about 20.7 grams of
            carbs, which consists of starch, sugar, and fiber (25Trusted Source).

            <br>
            * Oranges are a popular type of citrus fruit.

            They’re mainly composed of water and made up of about 15.5 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving. Oranges are
            also a good source of fiber (36Trusted Source).
            <br>
            <br>

            They consist mostly of water, as well as about 14.5 grams of carbs per 100 grams (42Trusted Source).

            carbs per 100 grams (52Trusted Source, 53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source).

            * Beets are also high in inorganic nitrates, which are converted into nitric oxide in your body. Nitric oxide
            lowers blood pressure and may decrease the risk of several diseases (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source).

            <br>
            <br>
            * That’s because nitric oxide relaxes your blood vessels, allowing oxygen to flow more efficiently during
